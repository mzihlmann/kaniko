# Fails on main@1d2bff5 before #3393:
# When we COPY files into an existing folder
# kaniko will not only copy the permissions from the context
# onto the newly created files and folders. But will
# also modify the permissions on the top level folder, even if it pre-exists.
# This is aberrant behaviour, other build-tools persist the permissions.
# In this specific case this leads to build-failure as sticky bit is lost on /tmp
